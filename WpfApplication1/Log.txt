Replaced Transform3DGroup with Transform3D (concatenating transformations via matrix multiplication) for performance issues.

Alik has suggested that we try projecting 4D shapes as 3D+color for the missing axis (each triangle has a gradient color, determined by its
vertices). Also, I'm keen on adding 3D+time eventually.
