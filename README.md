ParSurf
======

Parallel coordinates surface visualisation

Overview
--------

ParSurf is a software for visualising surfaces in parallel and cartesian coordiante
systems. The software is used for creating surfaces in cartesian coordinate system
and applying transformations on them, and see the result on the parallel coordinate
system. This application of the software is supposed to give you a better understanding
about how surfaces (or specific surface property) and transformation will look like in
parallel coordinate system.

Install
-------

Download the ParSurf.rar from the main folder. unzip it. click on the installation file. 

Releases
--------

Software was compiled and checked on Windows. Code can be taken and compiled for any
system however might be some adjustment required.
