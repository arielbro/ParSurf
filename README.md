ParSurf
======

Parallel coordinates surface visualisation

Overview
--------

ParSurf is a software for visualization of surfaces in [parallel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates "Parallel coordinates on Wikipedia") and cartesian coordiante
systems. The software allows for defining surfaces in arbitrary dimensional space, by parametric equations or point-cloud data, and applying arbitrary transformations on them. The aim of the software is to provide intuistic understanding of the connection between the representation of surfaces in either coordinate system, and assist in the search for patterns in the parallel coordinates visualization that correspond to interesting surface properties (e.g. convexity, cusp points).

Install
-------

The installation folder contains archive files for published versions.
To install, unrar, then click on the installation file. 

Releases
--------

Software was compiled and checked on Windows 7 x64. Code can be taken and compiled for any
system, however, some adjustment might be required.

Documentation
-------------

- For users:
In ParSurf.pptx you can find some general use examples, and a short guide to the software.

- For programmers:
The project was developed in C#. You can find the source code under WpfApplication1, hopefully sufficiently self documented (but probably not).
